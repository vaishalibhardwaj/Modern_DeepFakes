# Prerequisites
Machine learning essentially involves a ton of trial and error. You're letting a program try millions of different settings to land on an algorithm that sort of does what you want it to do. This process is really really slow unless you have the hardware required to speed this up. 

The type of computations that the process does are well suited for graphics cards, rather than regular processors. **It is pretty much required that you run the training process on a desktop or server capable GPU.** Running this on your CPU means it can take weeks to train your model, compared to several hours on a GPU.

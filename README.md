So, you want to swap faces in pictures and videos? Well hold up, because first you gotta understand what this collection of scripts will do, how it does it and what it can't currently do.

The basic operation of this script is simple. It trains a machine learning model to recognize and transform two faces based on pictures. The machine learning model is our little "bot" that we're teaching to do the actual swapping and the pictures are the "training data" that we use to train it. Note that the bot is primarily processing faces. Other objects might not work.
